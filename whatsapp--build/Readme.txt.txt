If you are attending the next activity class! Keep up with what we have done from the previous activity class. 
You can reference the source code from the particular Days, from the Days folder!!

The reason we are doing this is to get an idea of how code works in real life. And how it is applied in the real 
world! This is just the beginning. And the Beginning looks always messy, as we spend more time, we will no longer be 
a "Good Coder", we will be called "The Best Ones".

--I don't like to repeat this again, but I will!-- 
Tech Journeys (from Good to The Best Programmer) are all a long journey. The winner of the Tech journey won't be 
the one with a big brain, it won't be a smart person, it won't be the one with good marks. 

It will be the one who stays on this journey for a 'Longer Time'. Your goal should be to Program every day. Only those 
will be Winners. One who gives up, will not be a Winner (The Best Programmer). 

Here, Winning stands for going from Being Good to Being The Best Programmer.

If you look at the bigger picture of Enginner, and see the next 3 years as a Game. You will see One Who Programs Everday 
will be the Winner! You will realize every effort you put in now, will be worth it in the Future. Programming Every Day 
, it will Compound in the Future ðŸ“ˆðŸ“ˆðŸ“ˆ. In the End, The Choice is all Yours.
