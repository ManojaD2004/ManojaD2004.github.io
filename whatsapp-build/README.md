Total lines of codes: 726+
Project name: WhatsApp Build
Project Purpose/Goal: How HTML, CSS, and JS, works together!
Total Build Time: 28 hrs - Not including sleep/eating time, only Programming time (debugging, thinking, coding, seraching, etc.). You can build it in 4-5 hrs. 

You will never find this project anywhere in the world. Because 
Plain JS projects/tutorial is rare. There are thousands - millions of 
of tutorials/projects in React. I build this project for you to get an 
idea of how things work, how code works, how app works, how HTML, CSS, 
and JS works together.

We will not be writing code in plain HTML, CSS, JS. 
We will be using React-NextJS, Tailwind, TypeScript all are external 
libraries for HTML, CSS, JS. This is also what the world/industry uses.

All you have to Remember is that this is just a Beginning. We can do much 
more, and much better.

Comments will be written very soon for you to understand how the code works.
Take a look into the src code, and get an idea of how things work.
Feel free to do some changes and play with the code.


!!Project Description!! 

1. You can click on any contact list in the left panel (lp) and see its bgcolor changes.
-> Note that hover bgcolor and clicked bgcolor is different.

2. You can type anything in the search bar in the left panel, and the 
contact list changes/filters based on the inputed text/query. 

3. You can click on the icon next to search bar of the left panel, which 
says 'Ascending / Descending'. Clicking this icon will make contact list 
to change Order of the list based on their names - Ascending/Descending (Change ascending to descending by clicking again).

4. All the above icon have hover effects, which gets bigger

5. Click on any contact list notice how the right panel (rp) header 
changes its name and its dp_img.

6. Click on any contact list notice how the rp display message changes
based on the 'clicked person'

7. Write any message in the rp text input and press enter/ or click send 
button next to rp text input. You will see new message added in the msg 
field of rp.

8. Send a msg with a beginning of '$' symbol, you will see the msg has 
been send by that person not by you.

9. You can also notice that the recent messages changes based on new 
message send.

10. Send an empty message, you will get an error popup.

11. After sending message, click on any other cont, and come back 
to the same cont, notice how it preserves the message.

12. Click on the Dp photo of the header of rp, notice how we get to see 
bigger picture of dp of that person. Clicking on dp of lp, we get to see 
our own dp in bigger picture. 

=>This is a simple and complete working of FrontEnd.

=>Note: Refreshing the page will make all your sent message disapper. 
This is because due to lack of BackEnd infrastructure. We will learn and 
implement BackEnd in 3rd SEM. Then messages will be preserved even after 
refreshing the page, or closing the page.

=> Everything is completely procedural. Meaning you can change anything, 
and it works fine. All the elements are navigating/co-ordinating with 
each other perfectly as expected. This is a complete working of simple FrontEnd.
